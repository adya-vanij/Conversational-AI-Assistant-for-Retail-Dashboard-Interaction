<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
Retail professionals often struggle to extract meaningful business intelligence from their data dashboards due to technical barriers and the complexity of traditional business intelligence tools. Many team members spend excessive time trying to create or modify visualizations, or rely heavily on technical staff for basic data analysis. This creates bottlenecks in decision-making processes and prevents retail teams from fully leveraging their data for quick, informed decisions. Furthermore, the creation and distribution of regular reports consumes valuable time that could be better spent on strategic activities.
<h2>Solution Statement</h2>
A conversational AI assistant that democratizes data analysis by allowing retail professionals to interact with their dashboards using natural language, automatically generating visualizations, insights, and reports while maintaining the flexibility to customize and adapt to specific business needs.
